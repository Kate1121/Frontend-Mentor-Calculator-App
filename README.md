I would consider the theme selector to be one of the highlights of this project. Despite the amount of code necessary to add this functionality, the calculator will be styled with a dark or light theme depending on the user's preferred color scheme. Additionally, users can manually select the dark, light, or purple theme to style the calculator.

Another highlight of this project would be the ability to utilize the buttons on the calculator to enter whole numbers to be calculated or enter numbers into the number input field to be calculated.
